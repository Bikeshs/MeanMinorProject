Using this design pattern, any old client/server software (like VB/SQL or JAVA/Oracle) can be converted to new design to replace or run in parallel with original software.<br/>
You can easliy deploy this as an exe desktop app, host it over premises or over cloud or create an Android & iOS mobile app easily.
This design pattern is built for Big Data technologies and supports millions of transactions.<br/>
Also, this design pattern can be applied to any front end like React, VueJS, HTML/JS/Bootstrap/Project clarityto get any front-end look and feel.<br/>
